# 🚀 Retinal-Vessel-Segmentation

Built a task-driven GAN model with a U-Net generator and multi-scale discriminators to automate retinal vessel segmentation. The model uses perceptual loss to capture fine vessel structures, outperforming traditional U-Net and GAN methods on DRIVE and STARE datasets. Preprocessing techniques (grayscale, histogram equalization, gamma adjustment) improved clarity and training efficiency. Results show superior accuracy in detecting thin and low-contrast vessels, demonstrating the model’s potential for clinical diagnostics in ophthalmology.
